# Advent of Code - 2016

Messing around with [advent of code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016/), the code-puzzle advent calendar! 

Solutions:
* [Day 1](/lib/1) ( Part one and part two got mingled into a single result)
* [Day 2](/lib/2) ( I don't like this. It's messy and gross. )
* [Day 3](/lib/3) ( Much simpler. Streams and accumulations. )
